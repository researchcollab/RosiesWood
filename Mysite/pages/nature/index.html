<p>Rosie’s Wood is home to over 30 different tree species, planted between 1992 and 2024 to provide a varied habitat.  Some standing dead wood has been left as it provides an ideal environment for fungi and insects.  There are also many shrubs and other more unusual plants such as grape vines.</p>

<p>In January, the first snowdrops start to appear and are followed later by daffodils along the bank of the old cut.  This is a favourite nesting spot for the local swans.  To encourage other birds, nestboxes have been put up throughout the wood including an owl box.  A kingfisher visits the old cut; blackcap and long-tailed tits can be seen flitting through the trees and buzzards are seen overhead.  Recent tree plantings have been chosen to provide food for birds and animals.</p>
<p>Brashings have been stacked into hedges to provide hiding places for mice and children.  Between the pond and River Cam, an area of hazel is coppiced to encourage new growth and to provide light on the woodland floor.  Butterflys, such as the Gatekeeper, like to sunbathe.An otter and grass snake have been seen in the river.</p>
