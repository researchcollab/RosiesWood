<h3>Working Groups</h3>
<p>Rosie’s Wood is maintained by an informal, but hard-working group of volunteers, who also set up the arena for Jazz in the Wood.  They hold working groups every two or three months and almost daily in the run up to the concerts.</p>
<p>Woodland tasks include such things as planting trees, processing brashings, erecting bird boxes, pulling up invasive Himalayan balsam and clearing paths.  The benches and storage shed need occasional painting or repair.  Prior to Jazz in the Wood, the stage and bar need erecting.  Banners, lights and decorations are strung in the trees and the arena floor is cleared.  There is always a need for some tidying up afterwards and disposal of any remaining beer.</p>
<p>We welcome new volunteers at any time.  If you are interested in joining our friendly group, please get in touch via the contact page.</p>
